# happy_birthday_sms.py
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS PLEASE DO NOT THINK THIS IS A COMPLETED APPLICATION
PREFACE
Before anything else this project is to help me learn Devops principles namely how to use GitHub Actions, Docker and python.

This is a python script that will check my iContacts once a day to see who's birthday it is and send an SMS to them and alert me that it has done so. 
The idea is to have this setup and run on a Linux server to make sure I message people on their birthdays without having to change or add the data to a database or mess with it other than to initially set it up. Once I have a working prototype I will put 2 new sections in this README they will be as follows.
